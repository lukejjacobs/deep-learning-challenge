For this part of the assignment, youâ€™ll write a report on the performance of the deep learning model you created for Alphabet Soup.

The report should contain the following:

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
* The purpose of this analysis was to be able to determine if an organization would be successful in reaching their asked amount based on a couple of factors like income amount, application type, and affilation.


Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:

Data Preprocessing

What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
* The IS_SUCCESSFUL Column is our target variable.

What variable(s) are the features for your model?
* Everything else is our features for our model.

What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
* I would say we should drop name.

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
* I used 80 for the first layer, 30 for the second layer and 1 layer because I wanted to match what the starter code had.

Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
* I was not able to get to the target performance model. I was able to get close, but sadly I was not able to.

What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
* The main thing I tried to do was changing the activation types.


Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification 
problem, and then explain your recommendation.

* The overall results of the model are pretty solid. With an accuracy of close to 75% it is easier to predict then randomizing it.
* I believe random forest could me a different type of model that we could have used to get these results.
